# Car Logic Simulation Project

This project simulates a basic car driving experience using command-line inputs. The simulation requires users to follow logical steps to operate a car correctly, including actions like starting the ignition, releasing the handbrake, pressing the clutch, shifting gears, and accelerating. The simulation also enforces proper driving protocols, ensuring realistic behavior.

## Features
- **Realistic Driving Logic:** Simulates essential car operations like releasing the handbrake, starting the ignition, and shifting gears.
- **Interactive Commands:** Allows users to control the simulation through intuitive commands.
- **Error Handling:** Provides meaningful feedback for incorrect or invalid commands.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Ensures the user follows the proper sequence for operating the car.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driving-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd driving-simulation
   ```
3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python3 driving_simulation.py
   ```

## Command Reference
-----------------------------------------------------
| Command | Action                                  |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| `i`     | Turn on the ignition                    |
| `h`     | Release the handbrake                   |
| `c`     | Press the clutch                        |
| `1`     | Shift to gear 1                         |
| `2`     | Shift to gear 2                         |
| `a`     | Accelerate                              |
| `n`     | Shift to neutral                        |
| `0`     | Invalid command (for testing responses) |
-----------------------------------------------------

## Workflow
- **Starting the Car:**
  1. Release the handbrake using `h`.
  2. Ensure the gear is in neutral (`n`).
  3. Turn on the ignition with `i`.
- **Shifting Gears and Driving:**
  1. Press the clutch (`c`).
  2. Shift to the desired gear (e.g., `1` for gear 1).
  3. Accelerate with `a`.
- **Error Handling:** The simulation will provide feedback if steps are missed or commands are used incorrectly.

## Example Session
```
Enter command: h
Handbrake released. Ready to drive!
Enter command: n
Gear set to neutral.
Enter command: i
Ignition turned on.
Enter command: c
Clutch pressed.
Enter command: 1
Shifted to gear 1.
Enter command: a
Car is accelerating. Have a safe drive!
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
